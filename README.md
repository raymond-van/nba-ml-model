# nba-ml-model
Using machine learning to predict the outcomes of NBA games.

I also created a companion website for the model: https://nbamlpreds.herokuapp.com/.

## Running the model
Running **predict** will grab games being played today and spit out their respective win probabilities and point spreads.

## Updating the data
Running **update_data** will gather the most recent games that aren't currently in the dataset and add them to the data.

Dataset includes all games played (2018-19 season) as of 02/28/19.
